## Introduction

Blockchain integration in web applications can be challenging, especially when dealing with gas costs and complex smart contract interactions. Biconomy's AA stack provides a seamless solution to these challenges by abstracting away gas fees and simplifying the process of interacting with smart contracts.

This Next.js project serves as a starting point for developers looking to leverage Biconomy's features in their applications. It includes a basic structure and showcases how to integrate Biconomy's services to create gasless transactions and improve the overall user experience.

## Features

- **Bundler Integration:** Easily bundle and optimize your smart contracts using Biconomy's bundler.
- **Smart Accounts:** Enable your users to interact with smart contracts without needing to hold Ether for gas.
- **Paymaster Integration:** Handle gas payments efficiently using Biconomy's paymaster.
- **Gasless Transactions:** Implement gasless transactions for a smoother user experience.
- **Incomplete App:** This project is intentionally left incomplete, making it a blank canvas for your ideas and use cases.
